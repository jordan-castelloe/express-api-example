## About
This is a simple API to practice routing with Express. We started building it as a class and completed it on our own.

## To Run
- `` git clone ``
- `` npm run db:reset `` to build sample database
- `` node app.js ``
- In your browser, go to ``localhost:8080/api/v1/movies`` to see all the movies
- ``localhost:8080/api/v1/directors`` should show you all directors
- To view an individual movie or director, add its ID onto the end of the url
- Example: ``localhost:8080/api/v1/directors/2`` to view a director with an id of 2
